JWT_SECRET_KEY='In the depths of the ocean, a curious jellyfish named Lumina discovered a glowing treasure chest guarded by a school of sarcastic seahorses. With the help of her best friend, an adventurous octopus named Inkster, they deciphered the chestriddle and unlocked it, revealing a map to the Enchanted Pancake Island. At the summit, they faced the Waffle Guardian, a friendly yet forgetful dragon named Flapjack, who challenged them to a game of riddles. After a fierce but fun battle of wits, Lumina and Inkster won and were rewarded with the Crystal Waffle. As they activated its magic, the entire island lit up in a spectacular display of colors, and they were granted a wish. Lumina wished for endless adventures with her friends, and from that day on, they traveled through whimsical lands, spreading joy and laughter wherever they went.'
